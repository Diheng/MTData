Subject: Something goes wrong on MindTrails

Hello,

Sorry to tell you that it seems something is wrong on the MindTrails data collecting server, and below is the error
message:

Dec-01-2015 16:23:16 : HTTPConnectionPool(host='localhost', port=9000): Max retries exceeded with url: /api/export (Caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x10fd6b150>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 61] Connection refused',))
