# Everything about the MindTrails Project

## MindTrails Project
MindTrails Project is a JS/JAVA library for online, longitudinal psychological/interventional research studies. It is/will be optimal to
incorporate features like dynamic scheduling, cross-device/progress tracking, and on-the-fly machine learning (ML) enabled manipulation, etc..
It comes with a dual-server design that well suits studies that involved sensitive data like personal information and medical record.
